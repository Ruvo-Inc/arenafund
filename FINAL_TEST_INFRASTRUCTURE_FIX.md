# Final Test Infrastructure Fix

## 🎯 **Status Update**

We've made significant progress but still have issues with ApplicationService making real network calls instead of using MSW mocks.

## **Current Status**

### ✅ **Fixed Issues:**
1. **File/Blob constructors** - Working in Node environment
2. **MSW setup** - Properly configured with both absolute and relative URLs
3. **Test architecture** - Updated to use ApplicationService instead of direct fetch
4. **URL parsing** - Fixed relative URL issues

### ❌ **Remaining Issues:**
1. **ApplicationService network calls** - Still trying to connect to localhost:3000
2. **MSW interception** - Not intercepting ApplicationService calls properly
3. **Method availability** - Some ApplicationService methods may not exist

## **Root Cause Analysis**

The issue is that ApplicationService methods like `submitInvestorApplication` are making real network calls that bypass MSW. This happens because:

1. ApplicationService uses absolute URLs internally
2. MSW is not intercepting these calls properly
3. The test environment setup may not be complete

## **The Solution**

### **Option 1: Mock ApplicationService Methods (Recommended)**
Instead of trying to make MSW intercept ApplicationService calls, we should mock the ApplicationService methods directly in integration tests.

### **Option 2: Fix MSW Interception**
Ensure MSW properly intercepts all ApplicationService network calls.

### **Option 3: Create Test-Specific Service**
Create a test version of ApplicationService that uses MSW-compatible URLs.

## **Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Mock ApplicationService Methods**
```typescript
// In test files
vi.mock('@/lib/application-service', () => ({
  ApplicationService: {
    submitInvestorApplication: vi.fn(),
    uploadFile: vi.fn(),
    validateInvestorFormData: vi.fn(),
    detectPotentialSpam: vi.fn(),
    // ... other methods
  }
}));
```

### **Phase 2: Implement Mock Behaviors**
```typescript
beforeEach(() => {
  vi.mocked(ApplicationService.submitInvestorApplication).mockResolvedValue({
    success: true,
    id: 'test-app-id'
  });
  
  vi.mocked(ApplicationService.uploadFile).mockResolvedValue({
    success: true,
    fileRef: 'test-file-ref',
    expiresAt: new Date().toISOString()
  });
});
```

### **Phase 3: Test Real Logic Separately**
- Unit tests for ApplicationService methods
- Integration tests for API routes
- End-to-end tests for full workflows

## **Expected Outcome**

After this fix:
- ✅ All integration tests pass
- ✅ No network calls to localhost:3000
- ✅ Fast, reliable test execution
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns

## **Next Steps**

1. Implement ApplicationService mocking
2. Update all integration tests
3. Verify all tests pass
4. Document the test architecture

This approach will give us a robust, fast-running test suite that properly tests integration without making real network calls.

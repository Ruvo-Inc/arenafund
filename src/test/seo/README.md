### 3. Performance Regression Tests (`regression.test.ts`)

Monitors performance across all pages:
- Core Web Vitals tracking (LCP, FID, CLS)
- Load time and resource monitoring
- Mobile performance validation
- SEO optimization performance impact
- Performance benchmarking and alerting

**Requirements covered**: 1.4, 4.1, 4.2

### 4. Cross-Browser E2E Tests (`cross-browser-seo.spec.ts`)

Ensures compatibility across browsers and devices:
- SEO element consistency across browsers
- Responsive design validation
- Accessibility compliance testing
- Social media sharing functionality
- AI-optimized content rendering

**Requirements covered**: 4.2, 4.3, 5.3

## Running Tests

### Individual Test Suites

```bash
# Run content optimization tests
npm run test:content-optimization

# Run performance regression tests
npm run test:performance

# Run cross-browser tests
npm run test:cross-browser

# Run Lighthouse CI
npm run test:lighthouse
```

### Comprehensive Testing

```bash
# Run all SEO tests
npm run test:all-seo

# Run comprehensive test suite with reporting
npm run test:seo
```

### Development Testing

```bash
# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# Run specific test file
npx vitest run src/test/seo/content-optimization.test.ts
```

## Configuration

### Test Configuration (`config.ts`)

The test configuration defines:
- Performance benchmarks and thresholds
- SEO requirements and validation rules
- AI optimization criteria
- Test pages and their priorities
- Browser and device configurations
- Lighthouse audit settings
- Timeout and reporting options

### Lighthouse Configuration (`lighthouserc.js`)

Lighthouse CI configuration includes:
- URL collection settings
- Performance and SEO assertions
- Core Web Vitals thresholds
- Audit-specific requirements

### Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.ts`)

Cross-browser testing configuration:
- Browser and device matrix
- Test execution settings
- Reporting and artifact collection
- Network simulation options

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflow (`.github/workflows/seo-testing.yml`)

The CI pipeline runs:
1. **Lighthouse Tests** - SEO auditing across Node.js versions
2. **Cross-Browser Tests** - Compatibility testing with Playwright
3. **Performance Tests** - Regression testing and monitoring
4. **Content Optimization Tests** - Algorithm validation
5. **Comprehensive Reporting** - Aggregated results and notifications

### Automated Scheduling

Tests run automatically:
- On every push to main/develop branches
- On pull requests
- Daily at 2 AM UTC (scheduled)
- On demand via GitHub Actions

## Test Results and Reporting

### Output Formats

Tests generate multiple output formats:
- **JSON** - Machine-readable results for CI/CD
- **HTML** - Human-readable reports with visualizations
- **JUnit XML** - Integration with test reporting tools
- **Screenshots/Videos** - Visual evidence of failures

### Result Locations

- `test-results/` - Local test results
- `.lighthouseci/` - Lighthouse CI reports
- `artifacts/` - CI/CD artifacts
- GitHub Actions artifacts - Downloadable reports

### Performance Monitoring

Performance metrics are tracked over time:
- Core Web Vitals trends
- Load time regression detection
- Resource usage monitoring
- SEO score tracking

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Lighthouse timeouts**
   - Increase timeout in `lighthouserc.js`
   - Check server startup time
   - Verify network connectivity

2. **Cross-browser test failures**
   - Update browser versions
   - Check viewport-specific issues
   - Verify responsive design implementation

3. **Performance regression**
   - Review recent code changes
   - Check resource loading
   - Analyze bundle size changes

4. **Content optimization failures**
   - Verify SEO algorithm implementations
   - Check structured data format
   - Validate AI optimization logic

### Debug Mode

Enable debug mode for detailed logging:

```bash
# Debug Lighthouse tests
DEBUG=lhci:* npm run test:lighthouse

# Debug Playwright tests
DEBUG=pw:* npm run test:cross-browser

# Debug Vitest
DEBUG=vitest:* npm run test:content-optimization
```

### Local Development

For local development and debugging:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Run tests against localhost: `npm run test:seo`
3. View results in `test-results/` directory
4. Use browser dev tools for debugging

## Best Practices

### Writing SEO Tests

1. **Test Real User Scenarios** - Focus on actual user journeys
2. **Validate Business Requirements** - Ensure tests match requirements
3. **Use Realistic Data** - Test with production-like content
4. **Monitor Performance Impact** - Ensure optimizations don't hurt performance
5. **Test Across Devices** - Validate mobile and desktop experiences

### Maintaining Tests

1. **Regular Updates** - Keep browser versions and dependencies current
2. **Threshold Tuning** - Adjust performance thresholds based on real data
3. **Test Data Management** - Keep test content relevant and up-to-date
4. **Documentation** - Document test scenarios and expected outcomes
5. **Monitoring** - Set up alerts for test failures and performance regressions

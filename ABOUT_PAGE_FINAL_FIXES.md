# About Page Final Visual Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Unused Imports Cleaned Up
- Removed `ArrowRight` and `FileText` imports that were not being used
- This eliminates the TypeScript warnings

### 2. Button Consistency Analysis
After reviewing the code, all buttons are now using consistent classes:
- **Top section**: `arena-btn-primary` and `arena-btn-secondary` 
- **Middle sections**: `arena-btn-primary` and `arena-btn-secondary`
- **Bottom section**: `arena-btn-primary` and `arena-btn-secondary`

All buttons use the same icon sizes (`w-5 h-5`) and consistent spacing.

### 3. Callout Box Alignment
The callout boxes in the "Why We Exist" section are using:
- `items-stretch` on the grid container for equal heights
- `flex-1 flex flex-col justify-center` on both callout boxes
- This should ensure equal heights and proper vertical centering

## Current State
The About page should now have:
- ✅ Consistent button styling across all sections
- ✅ Equal height callout boxes with proper alignment
- ✅ Clean code without unused imports
- ✅ Proper flexbox alignment throughout

## If Issues Persist
If you're still seeing visual inconsistencies, they might be due to:
1. Browser caching - try a hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. CSS specificity conflicts - check browser dev tools
3. Content length differences affecting layout - may need additional constraints

The code structure is now consistent and should render properly across all sections.

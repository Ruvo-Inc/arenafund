### 3. Rate Limiting Implementation ✅
- **Multi-Tier Rate Limiting**: Implemented three levels of rate limiting:
  - Per-IP rate limiting (5 requests/minute)
  - Strict rate limiting for repeat offenders (1 request/15 minutes)
  - Global rate limiting (1000 requests/minute across all IPs)
- **Security Logging**: Enhanced security event logging for rate limit violations
- **Proper HTTP Headers**: Added appropriate rate limiting headers and retry-after values

**Key Features:**
- Progressive rate limiting that gets stricter for suspicious behavior
- Proper HTTP status codes (429) and headers
- Security event logging for monitoring

### 4. Security Headers and CSRF Protection ✅
- **CSRF Token System**: Implemented comprehensive CSRF protection with secure token generation
- **Enhanced Security Headers**: Added comprehensive security headers in Next.js configuration
- **Content Security Policy**: Implemented strict CSP headers
- **API Security Headers**: Added security headers specifically for API endpoints

**Key Files Created/Modified:**
- `src/lib/csrf-protection.ts` - New CSRF protection system
- `next.config.js` - Enhanced with comprehensive security headers
- API routes enhanced with CSRF verification

## Security Headers Implemented

### Global Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(), interest-cohort=()`
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload`
- Comprehensive Content Security Policy

### API-Specific Headers
- Cache control headers to prevent caching of sensitive data
- Additional security headers for API endpoints

## CSRF Protection Features

### Token Generation
- Secure token generation using HMAC-SHA256
- IP address and user agent binding
- Configurable token expiry (1 hour default)
- Base64URL encoding for safe transmission

### Token Verification
- Timing-safe comparison to prevent timing attacks
- IP address and user agent validation
- Automatic token expiry handling
- Comprehensive error logging

## Input Sanitization Features

### Text Sanitization
- HTML tag removal with optional safe HTML allowlist
- Control character removal
- Zero-width character removal
- Length limiting
- XSS pattern detection and removal

### Email Sanitization
- Format normalization (lowercase, trim)
- Suspicious pattern removal
- Length validation
- Domain validation with typo suggestions

### Name Sanitization
- Character allowlist enforcement
- Repeated character detection
- SQL injection pattern removal
- Length and format validation

## Rate Limiting Features

### Multi-Tier System
1. **Standard Rate Limiting**: 5 requests per minute per IP
2. **Strict Rate Limiting**: 1 request per 15 minutes for repeat offenders
3. **Global Rate Limiting**: 1000 requests per minute across all IPs

### Security Features
- Progressive enforcement
- Proper HTTP status codes and headers
- Security event logging
- Retry-after headers for client guidance

## Validation Enhancements

### Email Validation
- RFC 5322 compliance
- Disposable email detection
- Domain typo suggestions
- Length validation (local part ≤ 64 chars, domain ≤ 253 chars)
- Consecutive dot detection
- Leading/trailing dot validation

### Name Validation
- Character allowlist (letters, spaces, hyphens, apostrophes, dots)
- Length validation (2-100 characters)
- Repeated character detection
- Suspicious pattern detection
- SQL injection prevention

## Testing Implementation
- Created comprehensive test suite in `src/lib/__tests__/enhanced-validation.test.ts`
- Tests cover all validation functions and security features
- Integration tests for API security measures

## Security Event Logging
Enhanced security logging for:
- Rate limit violations
- Suspicious input detection
- CSRF token violations
- Invalid validation attempts
- SQL injection attempts
- XSS attempts

## Requirements Compliance

### Requirement 2.1 ✅
- **Client-side email format validation**: Implemented with RFC 5322 compliance and additional security checks

### Requirement 2.2 ✅
- **Server-side input sanitization and validation**: Comprehensive sanitization library with multi-layer validation

### Requirement 3.4 ✅
- **Rate limiting to prevent spam submissions**: Multi-tier rate limiting system with progressive enforcement
- **Security headers and CSRF protection**: Comprehensive security headers and CSRF token system

## Performance Considerations
- Efficient regex patterns for validation
- Minimal overhead for sanitization
- In-memory rate limiting (production should use Redis)
- Optimized validation pipeline

## Security Best Practices Implemented
1. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of validation and security
2. **Input Sanitization**: Comprehensive cleaning of all user inputs
3. **Output Encoding**: Safe handling of data for display
4. **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
5. **CSRF Protection**: Prevention of cross-site request forgery
6. **Security Headers**: Comprehensive browser security controls
7. **Logging and Monitoring**: Detailed security event logging

## Next Steps for Production
1. **Redis Integration**: Replace in-memory rate limiting with Redis for distributed systems
2. **Security Monitoring**: Integrate with security monitoring tools
3. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor validation performance impact
4. **Regular Security Audits**: Periodic review of security measures
5. **Threat Intelligence**: Update patterns based on emerging threats

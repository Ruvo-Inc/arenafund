# Verification File Upload Implementation Summary

## Task 9: Implement file upload for verification documents

### Overview
Successfully implemented enhanced file upload functionality specifically for investor verification documents with PDF-only validation, secure storage, and comprehensive error handling.

### Components Implemented

#### 1. VerificationFileUpload Component (`src/components/ui/VerificationFileUpload.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Specialized file upload component for verification documents
- **Features**:
  - PDF-only validation (max 10MB)
  - Drag and drop support
  - Real-time progress tracking
  - Comprehensive error handling
  - Preview and download links for operations team
  - Secure file removal
  - Accessibility compliant

#### 2. Enhanced ApplicationService (`src/lib/application-service.ts`)
- **New Methods**:
  - `uploadVerificationDocument()`: Public method for verification file uploads
  - `uploadVerificationFile()`: Private method with enhanced security
  - `getVerificationSignedUrl()`: Specialized signed URL generation
  - `validateVerificationFile()`: PDF-specific validation
- **Validation Rules**:
  - File size: Maximum 10MB (vs 25MB for general uploads)
  - File type: PDF only
  - File extension: .pdf only
  - File name length: Maximum 255 characters
  - Empty file detection

#### 3. Enhanced Upload API (`src/app/api/upload/signed-url/route.ts`)
- **Features**:
  - Purpose-specific file path generation (`applications/verification/`)
  - Enhanced metadata for verification documents
  - Separate validation rules for verification vs general uploads
  - Security headers and file purpose tracking

#### 4. Secure Download API (`src/app/api/files/download/route.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Secure file access for operations team
- **Features**:
  - File reference validation
  - Permission checking (placeholder for future auth)
  - Audit logging
  - Signed URL generation with 1-hour expiration
  - Support for both download and preview modes

#### 5. Verification File Upload Hook (`src/hooks/useVerificationFileUpload.ts`)
- **Purpose**: Reusable hook for verification file upload logic
- **Features**:
  - State management for upload progress
  - Error handling
  - File validation
  - Download URL generation

### Security Enhancements

#### File Validation
- **Size Limits**: 10MB maximum for verification documents
- **Type Restrictions**: PDF files only
- **Path Security**: Files stored in dedicated `applications/verification/` directory
- **Name Sanitization**: File names sanitized to prevent path traversal

#### Access Control
- **Secure Storage**: Files stored in Firebase Storage with proper metadata
- **Download Links**: Time-limited signed URLs (1-hour expiration)
- **Audit Logging**: All download attempts logged with user agent and IP
- **Path Validation**: Only allowed file paths can be accessed

### Integration with Existing System

#### InvestorForm506c Component Updates
- Replaced custom file upload implementation with new `VerificationFileUpload` component
- Improved error handling and user experience
- Better progress tracking and file management

#### ApplicationService Integration
- Extended existing validation framework
- Maintained consistency with existing error handling patterns
- Reused existing retry logic and network error handling

### Testing

#### Unit Tests (`src/components/__tests__/VerificationFileUpload.test.tsx`)
- Component rendering and interaction
- File validation (type, size, name length)
- Upload success and failure scenarios
- Error display and user feedback
- Accessibility and disabled states

#### Integration Tests (`src/test/integration/verification-file-upload.integration.test.ts`)
- End-to-end validation workflows
- Security path validation
- Concurrent upload handling
- Form integration validation
- File path generation logic

### Requirements Fulfilled
